# WebSocket with Python (Server)

This project is a WebSocket server implementation in Python that includes a basic port scanner functionality to identify devices on a private network. It uses Python's `asyncio` and `websockets` libraries to manage WebSocket connections and handle messages.

---

## **Features**
- Implements a WebSocket server.
- Scans the local private network for clients.
- Ensures connections are restricted to devices within the local network.
- Provides real-time messaging between the server and connected clients.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: 
  - `websockets`
  - `asyncio`

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingmuja12/Python-WebSocket-Server.git
  
   cd WebSocket-Python-Server
Usage
Ensure the server and clients are on the same private network.
Run the server using the command above.
The server scans the private IP range for connected clients.
Messages can be exchanged between the server and clients via WebSocket connections.


**Disclaimer**  
This software is intended strictly for educational and personal use within a private network environment. Unauthorized or improper use of this code, including port scanning outside your local network, is illegal and may result in severe legal consequences.
